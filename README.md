# The Line Machine

A creative art generation tool that creates beautiful abstract line compositions - inspiration by Carlos Cruz Diez's Couleur additive and multiple other artists. Generate unique images with customizable parameters including line counts, angles, colors, and probability distributions.

## Features

### 🎨 **Art Generation**
- **Segmented Lines**: Lines that change angle every 100 pixels for organic, flowing compositions
- **Continuous Lines**: Clean geometric lines with consistent angles
- **Custom Angles**: Define your own set of 3 angles for precise control

### 🌈 **Color System**
- **80+ Color Harmonies**: Curated palettes with creative names like "cosmic blaze" and "electric dusk"
- **Black**: Classic monochrome compositions
- **Gray**: Sophisticated grayscale artwork

### 📐 **Instagram-Ready Formats**
- **1:1** Square (1080×1080px) 
- **4:3** Landscape (1080×810px) 
- **3:4** Portrait (810×1080px) 
- **16:9** Wide (1080×607px) 

### 📊 **Probability Distributions**
- **Normal**: Favors vertical lines with gentle curves
- **Exponential**: Creates dramatic angular compositions

### 🎲 **Randomization**
- **Shuffle**: Randomizes lines (5-50), weight (3-25px), transparency (40-100%), colors, and distributions
- **Instant Generation**: One-click randomization for endless creativity

### 💾 **Export**
- High-quality PNG export (full resolution)
- Timestamped filenames for easy organization
- Optimized for social media sharing
